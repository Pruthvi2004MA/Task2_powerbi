# Task 2: Data Visualization and Storytelling

**Dataset:** Superstore.csv  

## Description
This Power BI dashboard provides insights into sales, inventory, and product distribution. The main objective is to tell a compelling story through visualizations. The dashboard includes:  
- **Category Distribution (Pie Chart):** Shows the proportion of items in each category.  
- **Number of Items per Category (Bar Chart):** Displays the count of items in each category.  
- **Top 10 Most Frequent Items (Horizontal Bar Chart):** Highlights the top 10 products in the dataset.  
- **Category Composition (TreeMap):** Visualizes the proportion of items across categories.  

Each chart has insight text boxes to explain key observations and business implications.  

## Steps Followed
1. Imported the dataset (`Superstore.csv`) into Power BI.  
2. Cleaned and transformed the data as needed.  
3. Created visuals (Pie Chart, Bar Chart, Top 10 Items, TreeMap).  
4. Added insight text boxes for each chart.  
5. Arranged all visuals on the dashboard for storytelling.
